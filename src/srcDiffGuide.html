    <h2>General Guide to srcDiff</h2>

    <p>The srcDiff format is an extension of srcML with the namespace
      <code>http://www.sdml.info/srcDiff</code> and the default prefix is <code>diff</code>.  The namespace
    primarily consists of the elements:
</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;diff:insert</code>&gt;</li>
      <li><code>&lt;diff:delete</code>&gt;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These elements are used to wrap the srcML elements and
      source-code text that is part of a difference.  Code that is not
      contained in these elements is common to both versions.  Due to
      well-formedness requirements of XML, another
      element <code>&lt;diff:common</code>&gt; may be nested
      in <code>&lt;diff:insert</code>&gt;
      or <code>&lt;diff:delete</code>&gt;.
    </p>

    <p>
      The format contains both versions of the document.  Both
      versions contain all content that is in common, i.e., not
      contained in a srcDiff element, or is directly in
      a <code>&lt;diff:common&gt;</code> element.  The first version
      also includes the contents of
      the <code>&lt;diff:delete&gt;</code> element, and the second
      version also includes the contents of
      the <code>&lt;diff:insert&gt;</code> elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since content that is not inside a srcDiff element is in common,
      a document with no changes will contain no srcDiff elements but
      only have the namespace for srcDiff declared.
    </p>

    <p>
      The srcDiff element uses the attribute <cite>type</cite> for special cases:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>type="whitespace"</code> Deleted or inserted content of
      the this change
      whitespace only (space, tab, newline).</li>
      <li><code>type="change"</code> The <code>&lt;diff:insert&gt;</code>
      or <code>&lt;diff:delete&gt;</code> is part of a matched set of
      inserts and deletes.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Generating srcDiff</h3>

<p>The srcDiff format is generated by the <code>srcdiff</code> tool.
  For example, to convert two versions of the same file to the srcDiff
  format:
</p>

<pre style="text-align : center">
srcdiff.exe v1\main.cpp v2\main.cpp -o main.cpp.xml
</pre>

<p>Note that the <code>srcdiff</code> tool internally takes care of the conversion
  to srcML.
</p>

<p>
In addition to conversion of two versions of the same file, the
<code>srcdiff</code>. tool can also generate a srcDiff archive similar to a srcML
archive.  This can be done by providing pairs of multiple files as
arguments, or by creating a file list.  The file list is in the
following form:
</p>

<pre style="text-align : left">
v1\main.cpp|v2\main.cpp
v1\f.hpp|v2\f.hpp
v1\f.cpp|v2\f.cpp
</pre>

<p>
Each pair of files is listed on a single line.  The two filenames are
separated by a vertical bar '|'.  The filename attribute of the srcML
element <code>&lt;unit&gt;</code> also contains both filenames
separated in the same manner.  To build a srcDiff archive from the
given file list the command is:
</p>

<pre style="text-align : center">
srcdiff.exe --files-from list.txt -o project.xml
</pre>

<p>
The code for the input options to <code>srcdiff</code> is taken from the code in
src2srcml, and we expect to eventually be able to handle all the input variations
of src2srcml in the <code>srcdiff</code> tool, e.g., input from tar archives.  This
would allow someone to specify two tar files consisting of two
different releases of a project.
</p>

<p>
Once in the srcDiff format, <code>srcml2src</code> can also be
used to work with srcDiff files.  Many of the options can be applied
to a particular version of the code using the new
option <code>--revision</code> which allows the selection of the first or
second version of the document.  To extract the first version of the
code the command is:
</p>

<pre style="text-align : center">
srcdiff.exe --revision 1 main.cpp.xml
</pre>

<p>
This selection of the particular version in the srcDiff file for
processing can be applied to almost all other options in srcml2src.
For example, to extract all the code in the files from the first
version to the current directory, the command is:
</p>

<pre style="text-align : center">
srcdiff.exe --revision 1 --to-dir=. project.xml
</pre>

<h3>Querying srcDiff</h3>

<p>
The srcDiff elements form a difference axis through the document,
which can be combined with the srcML elements in a query.  To find if
a particular part of the code is deleted, we look at the srcDiff
element that it is directly contained in, since the srcDiff elements
may be nested.  For example, to find all deleted functions the query
would be:
</p>

<pre style="text-align : center">
//src:function[ancestor::diff:*[1][self::diff:delete]]
</pre>

<p>
The first part of the predicate <code>ancestor::diff:*[1]</code> finds
the first containing srcDiff element in the reverse direction.  This
resulting element is checked to see that it is a delete.  While the
predicate may be verbose, it is actually computed quite efficiently
since the XPath evaluator must keep track of any open elements.
Finding inserted srcML can be done in a similar fashion by checking
for a <code>self::diff:insert</code>.
</p>

<p>
To find if a particular part of the code contains deleted or inserted
content, we look at the srcDiff elements that it contains.  For
example, to find all functions that contain deleted content the query
would be:
</p>

<pre style="text-align : center">
//src:function[descendant::diff:delete]
</pre>

<p>
The predicate <code>descendant::diff:delete</code> finds
any delete that is inside the function.  In this case
the predicate is much less verbose, but requires traversing the entire
tree inside the src:function.
Finding contained srcML can be done in a similar fashion with the predicate
<code>descendant::diff:insert</code>.
</p>

<p>
In order to make queries involving srcDiff more convenient and easier
to use, a set of XPath extensions function has been created to
hide much of these complexities.  These extension functions are directly
available for use as in XPath queries and XSLT programs in the srcML
tool <code>srcml2src</code>.  The definitions for them are included so
they can also be used in other XPath tools.  The functions are
used as predicates to filter the srcML content.

<p>
We will now show some examples of how srcDiff can be queried using the
extension functions, or the equivalent direct XPath.

<pre>
//src:function[diff:hasdifference()]
</pre>
</td>

</table>

<p>
More extension functions will be created as needed.
</p>

<p>
The results of these queries can be further refined to give the
desired data.  For example, to find all conditions in deleted functions:
</p>

<pre style="text-align : center">
//src:function[diff:deleted()]//src:condition
</pre>

<p>
When querying srcDiff it is important to remember that unless
specified, the result will include all elements, regardless if they
were inserted, deleted, or unchanged.  The following will find if all
inserted conditions inside of a function that is in common (i.e., the
function was not inserted or deleted):
</p>

<pre style="text-align : center">
//src:function[diff:common()]//src:condition[diff:deleted()]
</pre>

<p>

<h2>srcDiff Markup Method</h2>

<p>

  <code>srcdiff</code> has an option <code>--method</code> that changes how differences are marked up. This
  can be any number of things such as changing the granularity of the mark up.
  Currently, only two methods <code>raw</code> and <code>collect</code> exist.  Both affect
  source granularity mark up of expression and declaration statements. <code>raw</code>
  produces very fine granularity and <code>collect</code> reduces the granularity.  The default
  is <code>collect</code>.  The command to change to use the raw method is:

</p>

<p>

  <code>collect</code> reduces the source mark up granularity of expression and declaration statements (default).
</p>

<p>

  <code>raw</code> increases the source mark up granularity of expression and declaration statements
  The command to change to use the raw method is:

</p>

<pre style="text-align : center">
srcdiff.exe --method raw v1\main.cpp v2\main.cpp
</pre>

<!--
<pre>
  If v1\main.cpp contained <code>int n = a + b</code> and
  v2\main.cpp contained <code>int m = c + d</code>.

  With <code>collect</code> the following is produced (srcML removed for brevity):
  <code>&lt;diff:delete type="change"&gt;int n = a + b;&lt;/diff:delete&gt;&lt;diff:insert type="change"&gt;int m = c + d;&lt;/diff:insert&gt;</code>

  With <code>raw</code> the following would occur:
  <code>int &lt;diff:delete type="change"&gt;n&lt;/diff:delete&gt;&lt;diff:insert type="change"&gt;m&lt;/diff:insert&gt; = &lt;diff:delete type="change"&gt;a&lt;/diff:delete&gt;&lt;diff:insert type="change"&gt;c&lt;/diff:insert&gt; + &lt;diff:delete type="change"&gt;b&lt;/diff:delete&gt;&lt;diff:insert type="change"&gt;d&lt;/diff:insert&gt;</code>
</pre>
