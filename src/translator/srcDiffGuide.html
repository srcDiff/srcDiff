    <h1>General Guide to srcDiff</h1>

    <p>The srcDiff format is an extension of srcML with the namespace
    <code>http://www.sdml.info/srcDiff</code> with a default prefix <code>diff</code>.  The namespace
      primarily consists of the elements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;diff:insert</code>&gt;</li>
      <li><code>&lt;diff:delete</code>&gt;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These elements are used to wrap the srcML elements and
      source-code text that is part of a difference.  Code that is not
      contained in these elements is common to both versions.  Due to
      well-formedness requirements of XML, another
      element <code>&lt;diff:common</code>&gt; may be nested
      in <code>&lt;diff:insert</code>&gt;
      or <code>&lt;diff:delete</code>&gt;.
    </p>

    <p>
      The format contains both versions of the document.  Both
      versions contain all content that is in common, i.e., not
      contained in a srcDiff element, or is directly in
      a <code>&lt;diff:common&gt;</code> element.  The first version
      also includes the contents of
      the <code>&lt;diff:delete&gt;</code> element, and the second
      version also includes the contents of
      the <code>&lt;diff:insert&gt;</code> elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since content that is not inside a srcDiff element is in common,
      a document with no changes will contain no srcDiff elements but
      only have the namespace for srcDiff declared.
    </p>

    <p>
      The srcDiff element uses the attribute <cite>type</cite> for special cases:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>type="whitespace"</code> Deleted or inserted content of
        the this change
        whitespace only (space, tab, newline).</li>
      <li><code>type="change"</code> The <code>&lt;diff:insert&gt;</code>
        or <code>&lt;diff:delete&gt;</code> is part of a matched set of
        inserts and deletes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Generating srcDiff</h2>

    <p>
      The srcDiff format is produced primarily with a syntax
      differencing approach with careful attention paid to whitespace
      and other formatting.  The differences are computed down to the
      individual, low-level syntax, e.g., identifier, operator.
    </p>

    <p>The srcDiff format is generated by the <code>srcdiff</code> tool.
      For example, to convert two versions of the same file to the srcDiff
      format:
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : center">srcdiff.exe v1\main.cpp v2\main.cpp -o main.cpp.xml</pre>

    <p>Note that the <code>srcdiff</code> tool internally takes care of the conversion
      to srcML.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to conversion of two versions of the same file, the
      <code>srcdiff</code>. tool can also generate a srcDiff archive similar to a srcML
      archive.  This can be done by providing pairs of multiple files as
      arguments, or by creating a file list.  The file list is in the
      following form:
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : left">      v1\main.cpp | v2\main.cpp
      v1\f.hpp | v2\f.hpp
      v1\f.cpp | v2\f.cpp    </pre>

    <p>
      Each pair of files is listed on a single line.  The two filenames are
      separated by a vertical bar '|'.  The filename attribute of the srcML
      element <code>&lt;unit&gt;</code> also contains both filenames
      separated in the same manner.  To build a srcDiff archive from the
      given file list the command is:
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : center">srcdiff.exe --files-from list.txt -o project.xml</pre>

    <p>
      Conversion to the srcDiff format from source-code files is quite
      fast, typically about times the speed of converting a
      single file to srcML.  Note that each part of the pair of
      input files has to be converted (internally) to srcML, so the
      computation of the difference is about 50% of the time needed
      for conversion to srcML.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once in the srcDiff format, <code>srcml2src</code> can also be
      used to work with srcDiff files.  Many of the options
      of <code>srcml2src</code> can be applied to a particular version
      of the code using the new option <code>--revision</code> which
      allows the selection of the first or second version of the
      document.  This option is not available in the current general
      release of srcML, but is available in the srcDiff directory.  To
      extract the first version of the code the command is:
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : center">srcml2src.exe --revision 1 main.cpp.xml</pre>

    <p>
      This selection of the particular version in the srcDiff file for
      processing can be applied to almost all other options in <code>srcml2src</code>.
      For example, to extract all the code in the files from the first
      version to the current directory, the command is:
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : center">srcml2src.exe --revision 1 --to-dir=. project.xml</pre>

    <h2>Querying srcDiff</h2>

    <p>
      The srcDiff elements form a difference axis through the document,
      which can be combined with the srcML elements in a query.  To find if
      a particular part of the code is deleted, we look at the srcDiff
      element that it is directly contained in, since the srcDiff elements
      may be nested.  For example, to find all deleted functions the query
      would be:
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : center">//src:function[ancestor::diff:*[1][self::diff:delete]]</pre>

    <p>
      The first part of the predicate <code>ancestor::diff:*[1]</code> finds
      the first containing srcDiff element in the reverse direction.  This
      resulting element is checked to see that it is a delete.  While the
      predicate may be verbose, it is actually computed quite efficiently
      since the XPath evaluator must keep track of any open elements.
      Finding inserted srcML can be done in a similar fashion by checking
      for a <code>self::diff:insert</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To find if a particular part of the code contains deleted or inserted
      content, we look at the srcDiff elements that it contains.  For
      example, to find all functions that contain deleted content the query
      would be:
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : center">//src:function[descendant::diff:delete]</pre>

    <p>
      The predicate <code>descendant::diff:delete</code> finds
      any delete that is inside the function.  In this case
      the predicate is much less verbose, but requires traversing the entire
      tree inside the src:function.
      Finding contained srcML can be done in a similar fashion with the predicate
      <code>descendant::diff:insert</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to make queries involving srcDiff more convenient and easier
      to use, a set of XPath extensions function has been created to
      hide much of these complexities.  These extension functions are directly
      available for use as in XPath queries and XSLT programs in the srcML
      tool <code>srcml2src</code>.  The definitions for them are included so
      they can also be used in other XPath tools.  The functions are
      used as predicates to filter the srcML content.

      We will now show some examples of how srcDiff can be queried using the
      extension functions, or the equivalent direct XPath.

    <p>
      More extension functions will be created as needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The results of these queries can be further refined to give the
      desired data.  For example, to find all conditions in deleted functions:
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : center">//src:function[diff:deleted()]//src:condition</pre>

    <p>
      When querying srcDiff it is important to remember that unless
      specified, the result will include all elements, regardless if they
      were inserted, deleted, or unchanged.  The following will find if all
      inserted conditions inside of a function that is in common (i.e., the
      function was not inserted or deleted):
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : center">//src:function[diff:common()]//src:condition[diff:deleted()]</pre>

    <h2>srcDiff Difference Marking</h2>

    <p>
      The addition of syntactic structure in differencing allows for more
      then one way to mark the same set of differences.  In order to allow
      for choices, <code>srcdiff</code> has the option <cite>--method</cite>
      that changes how differences are collected and grouped.  The two
      current methods are:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><code>raw</code></strong> marks each individual change down to
      the name level.  For example, if the only change was the
      declaration where <code>int n = a + b;</code> became <code>int m = c
        + d;</code>, then this would be marked as 3 individual changes:
      <code>'n'->'m'</code>, <code>'a'->'c'</code>, and <code>'b'->'d'</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><code>collect</code></strong>
      and attempts to collect changes into a more meaningful result.
      The motivation behind this is that if almost all the identifiers
      in an expression (declaration) are changed, then the entire
      expression (declaration) was changed.
      For example, if the only change was the 
      declaration where <code>int n = a + b;</code> became <code>int m = c
        + d;</code>, then this would be marked as one large change, <code>'int n =
      a + b;'->'int m = c + d;'</code>.  Note that solitary small changes would still be
      individually marked, e.g., <code>'a + b'->'c + d'</code>.  This
      is still being refined as to in which situation the collection
      is being performed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The method <strong><code>collect</code></strong> is the default.  To use
      the method <strong><code>raw</code></strong> the command is:
    </p>

    <pre style="text-align : center">srcdiff.exe --method=raw v1\main.cpp v2\main.cpp</pre>

    <p>
      We believe that this category of options will grow in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>srcDiff Visualization</h2>

    <p>
       srcDiff provides output of visualization of the changes as a xhtml document.  The visualization overlays line based differencing over the srcDiff changes.  The option <cite>--visualize</cite> enables the output of the srcDiff visualization.  The associated line numbers are shown as well as a legend indicating information on the changes.  Note: a line number in previous/next version may appear more than once and if a diff change was on that line the visualization will show the diff change until the line changes and there is no difference on that line number.

    </p>

    <pre>
      The following summarizes the available visualization options.

       --visualize
              Sets output as the html visualization.

       --same Include files that have no change.

       --no-same
              Do not include files that have no change.

       --pure Include files that were completely added or deleted.

       --no-pure
              Do not include files that were completely added or deleted.

       --change
              Include only changes. Either a section of srcdiff indicates, a line change in diff, or both.

       --srcdiff-only
              Include changes that are only srcDiff changes and the line is not a diff change.

       --diff-only
              Include changes that are only diff changes and have no srcdiff change on the line.
    </pre>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>

    <p>
      The current implementation has some limitations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The code for the input options to <code>srcdiff</code> is taken from the code in
        <code>src2srcml</code>, and we expect to eventually be able to handle all the input variations
        of <code>src2srcml</code> in the <code>srcdiff</code> tool, e.g., input from tar archives.  This
        would allow someone to specify two tar files consisting of two
        different releases of a project.  We also expect to be adding
        additional options, such as input direct from srcML (instead
        of internal translation).
      </li>

      <li>Most of the testing has been on C code.  We have not found
        any surprises with C++/Java, but are still testing.</li>

      <li>
        The differencing algorithm produces non-optimal results with
        certain sequences of statements with small changes that are
        inserted/deleted.  This is currently being improved.  In
        addition, we are currently paying close attention to when
        deletes/inserts occur in common structures, such as nested ifs
        and switch statements.
      </li>
    </ul>
